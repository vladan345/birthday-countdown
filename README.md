## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

Learned how to compare and use Date() object, how to animate flip-flop animation.

### Continued development

First, this started as an animation challenge, simple countdown function wasn't too hard, but then I had an idea to make this countdown as a birthday reminder (I have a bad memory for my friend's birthdays). So really, for now, I'll wait and see if everything works and maybe optimize and write cleaner code, other than that, is pretty much a finished project.
